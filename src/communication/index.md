Space planning is the process of organizing and arranging physical spaces to optimize functionality, flow, and aesthetics. It involves analyzing the needs and requirements of a space, considering factors such as traffic patterns, furniture placement, and spatial relationships. The goal of space planning is to create an efficient and harmonious environment that meets the needs of its occupants while maximizing the use of available space.

Material direction refers to the intentional selection and use of materials in design to achieve specific aesthetic, functional, or environmental goals. It involves considering factors such as texture, color, durability, sustainability, and cost when choosing materials for a project. Material direction can influence the overall look and feel of a space, as well as its performance and longevity.

Lighting studies involve the analysis and design of lighting systems to enhance the functionality, aesthetics, and ambiance of a space. This process includes evaluating natural and artificial light sources, considering factors such as intensity, color temperature, and distribution. The goal of lighting studies is to create a well-lit environment that meets the needs of its occupants while also contributing to the overall design and atmosphere of the space.
