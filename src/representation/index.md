**High-Fidelity 3D Capture with Sensory Awareness**

We combine advanced 3D scanning tools with a sensitive understanding of architectural atmosphere. Our on-site intervention allows us to produce a precise and immersive digital twin of your existing building.

**Our Methodology**

	•	High-precision 3D scanning

	•	Accurate spatial geometry capture

	•	Faithful light and volumetric understanding

	•	Sensory-informed interpretation of ambiance

**But we go further than pure geometry**

<!-- the #our-services section begins here  -->
<anchor id="our-services"></anchor>

**We analyze**

	•	Luminous and thermal atmospheres

	•	Context

	•	Material presence

	•	Spatial perception (Materiality, volumes, proportions, etc.)

	•	Emotional tone of the existing space

**What You Receive**

	•	Detailed 3D models for renovation or redesign (we go on site and do all the measurements with our advanced professional tools)

	•	Immersive environments for VR integration

	•	Accurate documentation for architectural planning

	•	Atmosphere-sensitive information

	•	360° captured photographs of the existing building
